# OULAD-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis with Open University Learning Analytics Datasets (OULAD)

I downloaded OULAD from https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset then used Python to transformed the data before loaded them into Power BI for generating dashboard.

I involved all the ETL steps and my findings in Jupyter Notebook. At the end, I tried machine learning with K-nearest-neighbor method to predict the result of a student. Please use the google link attached in Jupyter Notebook or the link below to access my Power BI dashboard.
